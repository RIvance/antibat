# Anti-Bats

Get rid of those annoying and useless bats!

This mod only disable bats from naturally spawning. 
It does not remove them from the world if they are already there. 
It also does not prevent them from being spawned by mob spawner, 
spawning eggs and commands. So don't worry if your command blocks 
and data packs works depend on bats.

p.s. There may be already a mod that does this,
but I couldn't find one that works on fabric 1.19 
and above. So I made my own. 
(This is really a simple mod. 
I spend more time writing this README file that 
the mod itself lol.)
